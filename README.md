# Lora-SX127x-ESP32s-Arduino-Transceiver-Arduino-IDE-Code
*In this project, I communicate two Arduino or  two ESP32s with using SX1272MB2DAS semtech shield Transceivers. Modules and modules's pinouts have been given in this repo.

*Also, you can use these codes for many other microcontrollers such as Teensy, STM32.

*I wrote these arduino codes with using universal wireless communication library for Arduino (https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib).
